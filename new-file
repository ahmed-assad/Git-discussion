start with types of files [tracked [unmodified - modified - staged] and unttracked]
And locations of directories [local and ]

first step : crate dir [mkdir <dir name>]
cd [into new dir] 
init git into new dir : intit git
open the new dir and navigate in it [ls -al] --> Still no changes in objects folder
make new file in master [touch <file name>]
know status of new file (untracked file) --> [git status]
staged the changes and check the status [git add new-file] & [git status]
